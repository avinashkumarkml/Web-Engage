Subject: Project Extension Request

Respected Sir/Ma'am

With due respect, I am writing to request an extension on the deadline for the web application development project that I am currently working on. I was supposed to submit the final illustrations for the project on  February 5, 2023, but, regretfully, that won’t be possible. there are some family emergencies and a very hard time for me so I have to take care of my family and that means I won’t be able to work on the project during this time. 

I would like to submit the project on Wednesday, February 8, instead of Monday, February 5. I would be happy to submit a preliminary report before that date if you would like to see it.

I regret the delay this will cause in your publication schedule. I will complete the work as soon as possible.

Thank you for your consideration. I sincerely regret the delay.

Best Regards.
Avinash Kumar
